## 🟢 Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (Free)

1. **Go to GitHub**  
   Open your browser and visit:  
   🔗 [https://github.com](https://github.com)

2. **Sign Up**  
   Click the green **"Sign up"** button.

3. **Fill in Your Details**
   - **Username**: e.g., `yourname484`
   - **Email**: your real email (e.g., `you@gmail.com`)
   - **Password**: use a strong one (e.g., `MyPass123!`)
   - Click **"Continue"**

4. **Verify You’re Not a Robot**  
   Complete the CAPTCHA (e.g., "I’m not a robot").

5. **Confirm Your Email**  
   - GitHub will send a verification email.
   - Open your inbox → click **"Verify email"**.

✅ **Done!** You now have a GitHub account.

## 🟢 Step 2: Create a New Repository (Your First Project Folder)

A **repository (repo)** is like a project folder for your code.

### i. Create the Repo
- On GitHub, click the **`+`** icon (top-right).
- Select **"New repository"**.

### ii. Fill in Details
| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Repository name** | `my-first-project` |
| **Description** | *My first code project* (optional) |
| **Visibility** | ✅ Public (free) |
| **Initialize with README** | ❌ Unchecked |

👉 Click **"Create repository"**

✅ Your repo is created!

### iii. Create a New Branch (Recommended)
By default, you're on `main`. Let’s create a `dev` branch:

1. Click the branch dropdown (says `main`)
2. Type: `dev`
3. Click **"Create branch: dev"**

💡 You can switch between branches anytime in GitHub or VS Code.

---

## 🟢 Step 3: Install & Connect VS Code with GitHub

### i. Download and Install VS Code
🔗 Visit: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)  
→ Click **Download** → Run installer → Open after install.

✅ VS Code is ready!

### ii. Git Support (Built-in)
- No extra setup needed — Git is included by default.

### iii. Sign in to GitHub in VS Code
1. In VS Code, click the **Accounts icon** (bottom-left corner).
2. Click **"Sign in to GitHub..."**
3. A browser tab opens — log in and click **"Authorize Visual Studio Code"**.

✅ You're now connected!

---

## 🟢 Step 4: Clone Your GitHub Repo to VS Code

Now download your repo from GitHub to your computer.

### i. Copy the Repository URL
1. Go to your repo on GitHub:  
   `https://github.com/your-username/my-first-project`
2. Click the green **"Code"** button.
3. Copy the **HTTPS URL** (📋).

Example:
https://github.com/your-username/my-first-project.git


### ii. Clone in VS Code
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac)
2. Type: `Git: Clone` → Select it
3. Paste the URL → Press Enter
4. Choose a folder (e.g., `Desktop`, `Documents`)
5. Click **"Select Repository Location"**

✅ VS Code downloads your repo!

### iii. Open the Project
- After cloning, VS Code asks: *"Would you like to open the folder?"*
- Click **"Open"**

Now you can:
- ✅ See files in the Explorer (left panel)
- ✅ Edit, save, and manage code
- ✅ Push changes back to GitHub

---

## 🟢 Step 5: Pull Latest Code (If Updated on GitHub)

To sync changes made online:

### In VS Code:
1. Click the **Source Control icon** (🔄) on the left.
2. Click **`...` → Pull**

🎯 Shortcut:  
`Ctrl + Shift + P` → type `Git: Pull`

✅ Your local code is now up to date!

---

## 🔍 Verification Process

After setup, verify everything works correctly:

---

## 🟢 Step 6: Confirm Files Are Correct

1. Open **Explorer** (📁 icon on the left).
2. Check if files like `hello.py`, `README.md` appear.
3. Open a file — does it match GitHub?

✅ This confirms correct clone.

---

## 🟢 Step 7: Make a Small Test Edit

Let’s test editing:

1. Open any file (e.g., `hello.py` or `README.md`)
2. Add this line:
   ```python
   print("This is a test from VS Code!")
   
3. Save the file: Press Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac).
✅ This confirms you can edit files locally.

--------------------------------------------------------

## 🟢 Step 8: Commit and Push the Change

i. Click the Source Control icon (🔄) on the left.
ii. You’ll see your changed file under "Changes".
iii. Click the + (Stage Changes) button.
iv. In the message box, type a commit message:

test: My first edit from VS Code

v. Click the ✓ (Commit) button.
vi. Click the ↑ (Push) button (or go to Ctrl + Shift + P → Git: Push).
✅ If no error appears, your change is sent to GitHub!

--------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 9: Verify on GitHub Website
i. Open your browser and go to:

https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name

ii. Check:
- Did your commit message appear?
- Is your new code visible in the file?

✅ This confirms: VS Code ↔ GitHub connection is working perfectly!

--------------------------------------------------------

## 🟢 Step 10: Optional – Pull Again (Reverse Test)
If you (or someone else) make a change directly on GitHub:

i. Go back to VS Code.
ii. Click ... → Pull in the Source Control panel.
iii. Confirm the change appears in your local files.

✅ This proves you can stay in sync with the team.

(These steps are very helpful for very beginners & by these step beginners can understand the Code work process with Github, thank you)
